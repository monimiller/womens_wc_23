### Welcome to the Women's world cup 2023 Analysis

My name is Monica. I'm a data nerd and washed up soccer player who can still
claim a couple of D3 records to her name. Of course with the world cup I wanted
to jump in and get my hands dirty.

How did I get here? I work for Starburst as a developer advocate. I'm usually
much more motivated when the data is something interesting, and with the
upcoming webinars I had, I thought why not do a demo involving women's world cup data.
I then found Gustavo's analysis, and figured I'd do my part
here to support women's sports - I can do my part and analyze the women's data
and popularize the tournament just a little bit more. #EqualityinSport

Instead of just doing a demo for Starburst, I decided to push myself out of my comfort
zone and try predictive analysis for the women's world cup. One small
step for women's equality, one giant leap for Monica.

A big thank you and major credit towards [Gustavo
Santos](https://gustavorsantos.medium.com/predicting-results-and-goals-with-machine-learning-599e99d6e3e0)
who's project on the men's world cup I then recreated for the women. You can

## Monica vs the Machine

I plan to write a four part article series around this - The Introduction, The
Data Wrangling, The Analysis, and The Result. Here's the TLDR for each one.


## The Introduction



## The Data Wrangling


Every project starts with the data wrangling. I found this [Kaggle
dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/martj42/womens-international-football-results?select=results.csv),
then did some data cleaning to only take into account data from the last 20
years. I also only considered countries that were in the world cup. The data was
not fully up to date, so I updated the data from any international matches
including these teams within the last year.


## The Analysis



## The Result
